## High Severity

### H1 — TOCTOU on giveaway action returns 500 instead of 409

**File:** `src/app/api/giveaway/action/route.ts`
**Issue:** Concurrent duplicate action requests could pass the pre-check and hit the DB unique constraint, returning a generic 500 error instead of `DUPLICATE_ACTION` (409).
**Fix:** Added inner try/catch around `recordGiveawayAction()` that catches `UNIQUE constraint failed` and returns `DUPLICATE_ACTION`. The pre-check remains as a fast-path optimization.

### H2 — Duplicate "Home" breadcrumb on every page

**File:** `src/components/layout/breadcrumbs.tsx`
**Issue:** The Breadcrumbs component auto-prepended `{ label: "Home", href: "/" }`, but every caller already included Home in their items array. Result: "Home > Home > ..." in both visible breadcrumbs and BreadcrumbList JSON-LD.
**Fix:** Removed the auto-prepend from the component. Callers already pass the full breadcrumb chain including Home.

### H3 — Terms/privacy FAQs and RelatedPages constrained to max-w-3xl

**Files:** `src/app/(public)/terms/page.tsx`, `src/app/(public)/privacy/page.tsx`
**Issue:** FaqSection and RelatedPages were rendered inside the `max-w-3xl` content wrapper, making them narrower than on all other pages.
**Fix:** Moved FaqSection and RelatedPages outside the constrained wrapper div, matching the layout pattern used by home, blog, waitlist, giveaway, and contact pages.

### H4 — Four exported validators completely untested

**File:** `src/lib/__tests__/validation.test.ts`
**Issue:** `validateSlug`, `validatePostBody`, `validatePostUpdateBody`, and `validatePageBody` had zero test coverage despite being the gatekeepers for all admin content API routes.
**Fix:** Added comprehensive tests for all four validators covering valid inputs, missing required fields, type errors, boundary lengths, and edge cases.

### H5 — Referral page missing OG URL and canonical

**File:** `src/app/(public)/waitlist/[code]/page.tsx`
**Issue:** The referral dashboard page had no `openGraph.url` or `alternates.canonical`, causing poor social sharing previews.
**Fix:** Added `openGraph.url` and `alternates.canonical` pointing to the canonical waitlist page URL.

---

## Medium Severity

### M1 — Mass assignment in page update allows slug (PK) overwrite

**File:** `src/lib/pages.ts` (`updatePage`), `src/app/api/admin/pages/[slug]/route.ts`
**Issue:** The entire request body was spread into the DB SET clause. An admin could include `slug` in the PUT body to change the primary key, orphaning child page references and bypassing reserved slug checks.
**Fix:** (a) `updatePage` now uses an explicit field allowlist — `slug` is never included in the update set. (b) The API route strips `slug` from the body before passing to `updatePage`.

### M2 — Mass assignment in post update allows overwriting protected fields

**File:** `src/lib/blog.ts` (`updatePost`)
**Issue:** Spreading `...data` into the update set allowed overwriting `id`, `createdAt`, and `publishedAt` via the request body.
**Fix:** Replaced the spread with an explicit allowlist of permitted fields (`slug`, `title`, `description`, `content`, `faqs`, `coverImage`, `author`, `tags`, `published`).

### M3 — Non-atomic page deletion (child cleanup + delete)

**File:** `src/lib/pages.ts` (`deletePage`)
**Issue:** Two separate DB operations (nullify child parentSlug, then delete page) without a transaction. A crash between steps could leave data inconsistent.
**Fix:** Wrapped both operations in `db.batch()` for atomic execution, matching the pattern already used in `createSubscriberWithReferral`.

### M4 — TOCTOU on publishedAt (read-then-conditional-write)

**File:** `src/lib/blog.ts` (`updatePost`)
**Issue:** The function read the existing post to check if `publishedAt` was null, then conditionally set it. Concurrent updates could both set `publishedAt`, overwriting the original publish date.
**Fix:** Replaced the read-then-write with a single SQL `CASE WHEN published_at IS NULL THEN {now} ELSE published_at END` expression, making the first-publish-date assignment atomic.

### M5 — Referral code collision with no retry

**File:** `src/app/api/waitlist/route.ts`, `src/lib/referral.ts`
**Issue:** If `generateReferralCode()` produced a code that collided with an existing one, the unique constraint error surfaced as a generic 500.
**Fix:** Wrapped subscriber creation in a 3-attempt retry loop. On unique constraint failure, checks if it's an email duplicate (returns existing subscriber) or a referral code collision (retries with a new code).

### M6 — Post slug update collision returns 500

**File:** `src/app/api/admin/posts/[id]/route.ts`
**Issue:** Changing a post's slug to one that already exists threw a unique constraint error caught as a generic "Failed to update post" (500).
**Fix:** Added inner try/catch that detects `UNIQUE constraint failed` and returns a clear `VALIDATION_ERROR` message: "A post with this slug already exists".

### M7 — Page slug (PK) changeable via update API

**File:** `src/lib/pages.ts`, `src/app/api/admin/pages/[slug]/route.ts`
**Issue:** The page update endpoint could change the primary key (slug), breaking child references, related page links, sitemap URLs, and external bookmarks.
**Fix:** The `updatePage` function's allowlist explicitly excludes `slug`. The API route also strips `slug` from the request body as defense-in-depth.

### M8 — Post deletion does not clean up R2 assets

**File:** `src/app/api/admin/posts/[id]/route.ts`, `src/lib/blog.ts`
**Issue:** Deleting a post removed the DB row but left orphaned images in R2 (`blog/{slug}/cover.webp`, inline images).
**Fix:** `deletePost` now returns the deleted post's slug. The DELETE API route uses it to list and delete all R2 objects under `blog/{slug}/` (best-effort, fire-and-forget).

### M9 — TOCTOU on giveaway entry returns 500

**File:** `src/app/api/giveaway/enter/route.ts`
**Issue:** Concurrent duplicate entries hit the unique constraint and returned 500 instead of returning the existing entry.
**Fix:** Added try/catch around `createGiveawayEntry` that catches unique constraint failures and re-fetches the existing entry.

### M10 — TOCTOU on waitlist signup returns 500

**File:** `src/app/api/waitlist/route.ts`
**Issue:** Concurrent signups with the same email hit the unique constraint and returned 500.
**Fix:** The retry loop (added for M5) also catches email-duplicate unique constraint failures and returns the existing subscriber's data.

### M11 — R2 assets proxy serves all bucket objects without path validation

**File:** `src/app/api/assets/[...key]/route.ts`
**Issue:** The public asset endpoint served any R2 key without path restriction. Also used `immutable` cache headers on deletable content.
**Fix:** (a) Added path validation: only `blog/`, `uploads/`, and `og/` prefixes allowed; `..` segments rejected. (b) Changed cache from `immutable, max-age=31536000` to `max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=604800`.

### M12 — Missing role="alert" on admin editor error messages

**Files:** `post-editor.tsx`, `page-editor.tsx`, `tracking-settings-editor.tsx`, `image-upload.tsx`
**Issue:** Error messages in admin editors lacked `role="alert"`, so screen readers wouldn't announce them.
**Fix:** Added `role="alert"` to error message `<p>` elements. Used `role="status"` for the tracking settings editor since it shows both success and error.

### M13 — Published switch not associated with label

**Files:** `post-editor.tsx`, `page-editor.tsx`
**Issue:** The `<Switch>` had no `id` and the `<Label>` had no `htmlFor`, so they were not programmatically associated.
**Fix:** Added `id="post-published"` / `id="page-published"` to switches and matching `htmlFor` to labels.

### M14 — FAQ/RelatedPages editor labels not associated with inputs

**Files:** `faq-editor.tsx`, `related-pages-editor.tsx`
**Issue:** Input labels used `<Label>` without `htmlFor`, and inputs had no `id` attributes.
**Fix:** Added index-based `id` attributes to inputs (e.g., `faq-q-${i}`, `rp-title-${i}`) and matching `htmlFor` to labels.

### M15 — Sitemap includes noindex pages

**File:** `src/app/sitemap.ts`
**Issue:** Content pages with `metadata.noindex: true` were included in the sitemap, sending contradictory signals to search engines.
**Fix:** Added filter to skip pages where `(page.metadata as Record<string, unknown> | null)?.noindex` is truthy.

### M16 — Giveaway Event JSON-LD missing startDate

**File:** `src/app/(public)/giveaway/page.tsx`
**Issue:** Google's Event structured data requires `startDate`, but only `endDate` was present.
**Fix:** Added `startDate` field using `metadata?.startDate` with fallback to `page?.createdAt`.

### M17 — Admin sidebar has no active state

**File:** `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`
**Issue:** No visual or semantic indication of which admin page is active. The `pathname` was available but unused for nav highlighting.
**Fix:** Added `aria-current="page"` and `bg-accent text-accent-foreground` visual style to the matching nav link using `cn()`.

### M18 — `requireAdminSession` has no unit tests

**File:** `src/lib/__tests__/admin-auth.test.ts` (new)
**Issue:** The single point of admin auth enforcement (used in 9 API routes) had no isolated tests.
**Fix:** Created test file with mocked `next/headers` and `@/lib/admin` covering: no cookie, invalid session, and valid session.

### M19 — Missing error code tests, no coverage thresholds, Chromium-only E2E

**Files:** `src/lib/__tests__/api.test.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`
**Issue:** Four error codes (`TURNSTILE_FAILED`, `GIVEAWAY_ENDED`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `RATE_LIMITED`) untested. `getClientIp` untested. No coverage thresholds enforced.
**Fix:** (a) Added tests for all 4 missing error codes and `getClientIp`. (b) Added coverage thresholds to vitest config (70% lines/functions, 60% branches). (c) Cross-browser E2E deferred — noted as a future improvement since WebKit/Firefox require additional Playwright browser installs.

## Low Severity

### L1 — Missing ID validation on post DELETE

**File:** `src/app/api/admin/posts/[id]/route.ts`
**Issue:** DELETE handler didn't validate `id` parameter, allowing garbage IDs to return `{ success: true }`.
**Fix:** Added same `Number.isInteger` + positive check as the PUT handler.

### L2 — Consent cookie missing Secure flag

**File:** `src/lib/cookies.ts`
**Issue:** `setConsentCookie` didn't include the `Secure` flag in the cookie string.
**Fix:** Added `;Secure` to the cookie attributes.

### L3 — Tracking settings boolean fields not type-validated

**File:** `src/app/api/admin/tracking/route.ts`
**Issue:** Boolean fields from the request body were destructured with `as` casts without runtime type checks. Non-boolean values like `"yes"` or `1` could be stored.
**Fix:** Added runtime validation loops that check `typeof val !== "boolean"` and `typeof val !== "string"` for the respective field groups, returning `VALIDATION_ERROR` on mismatch.

### L4 — Timer leak in tracking fetch

**File:** `src/lib/tracking.ts`
**Issue:** `clearTimeout` was only called on the success path. If fetch was aborted, the timer would leak until it fired.
**Fix:** Moved `clearTimeout` to `finally` blocks in both `sendMetaConversionEvent` and `sendGaConversionEvent`.

### L5 — Image block renders empty alt for meaningful images

**File:** `src/components/content/blocks/image-block.tsx`
**Issue:** `alt={block.alt ?? ""}` produced empty alt text for content images, causing screen readers to skip them.
**Fix:** Changed to `alt={block.alt || "Blog image"}` as a fallback for missing alt text.

### L6 — Callout block lacks semantic role

**File:** `src/components/content/blocks/callout-block.tsx`
**Issue:** Callout blocks (info, tip, warning) had no ARIA role to communicate their purpose.
**Fix:** Added `role="note"` to the outer div.

### L7 — Table block missing caption

**File:** `src/components/content/blocks/table-block.tsx`
**Issue:** Data tables had no `<caption>` or `aria-label`.
**Fix:** Added `aria-label="Data table"` to the table element.

### L8 — Download block SVG icon not hidden from screen readers

**File:** `src/components/content/blocks/download-block.tsx`
**Issue:** Decorative SVG icon lacked `aria-hidden="true"`.
**Fix:** Added `aria-hidden="true"` to the SVG element.

### L9 — Loading spinner has no accessible label

**File:** `src/app/(public)/loading.tsx`
**Issue:** The CSS spinner had no role or label for screen readers.
**Fix:** Added `role="status"` wrapper and `<span className="sr-only">Loading...</span>`.

### L10 — Referral dashboard error message lacks role="alert"

**File:** `src/components/waitlist/referral-dashboard.tsx`
**Issue:** Error message paragraph missing `role="alert"`.
**Fix:** Added `role="alert"`.

### L11 — Navigation landmarks not distinguished

**Files:** `src/components/layout/header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/footer.tsx`
**Issue:** Multiple `<nav>` elements on the page lacked distinguishing `aria-label` values.
**Fix:** Added `aria-label="Main navigation"` to header nav, wrapped footer links in `<nav aria-label="Footer navigation">`.

### L12 — Cookie consent banner lacks accessibility attributes

**File:** `src/components/shared/cookie-consent-banner.tsx`
**Issue:** The fixed-position cookie banner had no `role` or `aria-label`.
**Fix:** Added `role="dialog"` and `aria-label="Cookie consent"` to the banner wrapper.

### L13 — Minor test infrastructure gaps

**Files:** `e2e/global-setup.ts`, `package.json`, `vitest.config.ts`
**Issue:** (a) `admin_sessions` table not cleared between E2E runs. (b) No unified `test:ci` script. (c) No coverage thresholds.
**Fix:** (a) Added `DELETE FROM admin_sessions` to E2E global setup. (b) Added `test:ci` script. (c) Added coverage thresholds (70/70/60).

## Systematic Patterns Addressed

### 1. TOCTOU on unique fields (H1, M9, M10)
All three public-facing endpoints (giveaway action, giveaway entry, waitlist signup) had the same read-check-insert pattern with a generic 500 catch. Each now catches `UNIQUE constraint failed` specifically and returns the appropriate 4xx response.

### 2. Mass assignment (M1, M2, M7)
Update functions previously spread the entire request body into the DB SET clause. Both `updatePost` and `updatePage` now use explicit field allowlists. The page update API route also strips `slug` from the body as defense-in-depth.

### 3. Non-atomic operations (M3, M4)
Page deletion and publishedAt assignment both had TOCTOU patterns. Page deletion now uses `db.batch()`. publishedAt uses an atomic SQL `CASE` expression.
